# Creating a Map of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) Collection Sites in Thailand

The figures and content in this repository are derived from the following publication:

**Wennmann, J.T., Senger, S., Ruoff, B., Jehle, J.A., Suraporn, S. (2024). Distribution and genetic deviersity of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus in mass-reared silkworms in Thailand. Journal of Invertebrate Pathology, xxx xxx xxx. [DOI link to the publication]**

## Aim of this repository

-   Demonstration of the R code for creating a map of a country (here Thailand) to mark collection locations of baculovirus samples.

-   Learn how R can be used to analyse the correlation between geographical and genetic distance.

## Map of Thailand

As part of the study, 21 locations in Thailand were sampled to collect BmNPV (Wennmann et al., 2024). For a better visualization, a map showing all the provinces of Thailand was created. The provinces were dividgied into four regions. The regions were coloured according to the intensity of agricultural cultivation of mulberry trees. The locations of the BmNPV samples were marked with different symbols, depending on whether they were analysed using whole genome sequencing (WGS) or only partial gene sequencing (Sanger sequencing). Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on the sequence data, and depending on the phylogenetic clade, the symbols on the map were coloured accordingly. This complex representation conveys a lot of interesting information ([Figure](https://github.com/wennj/bmnpv-map-thailand/blob/main/output/mulbarry%20plantation%20thailand%20with%20signs.png)).
